This repository contains licenses used by open source softwares. This Licenses are owned by the user who developed the open source software. 
GPL=
The GNU General Public License, often shortened to GNU GPL (or simply GPL), lists terms and conditions for the copying, modification and redistribution of open source software. The GPL was created by Richard Stallman in order to protect GNU software from being made proprietary.

It is a specific implementation of his "copyleft" concept. According to Stallman, a copyleft license is a derivative of copyright law that serves "the opposite of its usual purpose: instead of a means of privatizing software, it becomes a means of keeping software free."

The GPL itself is under copyright notice by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), a tax-exempt charitable organization founded by Stallman's GNU project in order to generate funding for free software development.
APACHE=
The Apache License is a permissive free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).[4] It allows users to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software under the terms of the license, without concern for royalties. The ASF and its projects release their software products under the Apache License. The license is also used by many non-ASF projects.

Free and open source software is a term used to refer groups of software consisting of both free software and open source software
